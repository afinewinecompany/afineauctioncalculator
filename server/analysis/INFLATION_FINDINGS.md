## Statistical Methods

### Inflation Calculation

Inflation rate is calculated using weighted averaging to reduce the distorting effect of low-value players:

- **Players $1-$2**: Weight reduced by 75% (weight = value × 0.25)
- **Players $3-$5**: Weight reduced by 50% (weight = value × 0.5)
- **Players $6+**: Full weight (weight = value)

This approach ensures that a $1 player selling for $3 (200% inflation) doesn't disproportionately skew results.

### Tier Assignment

Players are grouped into 10 tiers based on their projected value rankings within each auction:
- **Tier 1**: Top 10% of players by projected value
- **Tier 2**: 10-20% percentile
- **Tier 10**: Bottom 10%

### Confidence Intervals

95% confidence intervals are calculated using the standard error of the mean across auctions.

## Recommendations

Based on this analysis:

1. **High Inflation Environment**: Average inflation of 20.3% suggests aggressive bidding. Consider targeting undervalued tiers and positions.
2. **Tier Strategy**: Tier 7 shows 1580.4% inflation - consider fading this tier or budgeting accordingly.
3. **Position Strategy**: MiLB shows 1347.4% inflation - prioritize early or target depth later.
4. **Value Range**: $1-$5 players show highest inflation at 991.6% - adjust bids accordingly in this range.
