## Key Findings Summary

### Overall Inflation
- **Average**: 20.3% across 6 auctions
- **Range**: -28% to +101%
- **Variability**: High (σ = 44.8%), indicating league-specific factors matter

### Critical Insights

1. **Low-Value Player Inflation**
   - $1-$5 players show 992% average inflation
   - Primarily driven by starting pitchers (SP) being systematically undervalued in projections
   - Top SPs like Tarik Skubal, Paul Skenes consistently went for $25-$50 despite $1 projections

2. **Tier-Based Patterns**
   - **Tier 1** (elite players): -20% inflation (bargains!)
   - **Tiers 3-10** (mid-tier to bench): 500-1600% inflation
   - This suggests projections undervalue depth and overvalue stars

3. **Position Scarcity**
   - **Most Inflated**: MiLB (1347%), RP (975%), SP (870%)
   - **Least Inflated**: SS (76%), 1B (84%), OF (84%)
   - Pitching shows extreme inflation vs hitting

4. **Projection System Issues**
   - The Steamer projections appear to significantly undervalue:
     - Starting pitchers (especially elite ones)
     - Relief pitchers
     - Minor league prospects
   - This suggests the value calculator may need pitching adjustments

## Auction Details

| Auction ID | Teams | Total Spent | Inflation | Key Characteristic |
|------------|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1358 | 12 | $4,643 | -11.8% | Conservative bidding |
| 1351 | 12 | $4,671 | -11.6% | Conservative bidding |
| 1200 | 12 | $2,585 | +17.5% | Large roster (1461 players) |
| 1201 | 12 | $5,834 | +55.2% | Aggressive bidding |
| 34 | 12 | $7,962 | +100.6% | Very aggressive |
| 968 | 12 | $3,256 | -28.0% | Very conservative |

## Notable Player Examples

### Most Overvalued (across all auctions)
1. **Tarik Skubal** (SP): $1 → $46-48 (+4500-4700%)
2. **Paul Skenes** (SP): $1 → $29-50 (+2800-4900%)
3. **Yoshinobu Yamamoto** (SP): $1 → $25-45 (+2400-4400%)

### Most Undervalued (across all auctions)
1. **Mason Miller** (RP): $343 → $8-16 (-95% to -98%)
2. **Edwin Diaz** (RP): $537 → $12-13 (-98%)
3. **Ronald Acuna Jr** (OF): $67 → $20-49 (-27% to -70%)

## Recommendations

### For Auction Participants

1. **Target Elite Hitters**: Tier 1 players (especially elite hitters) show negative inflation - they're bargains!

2. **Budget for Pitching Inflation**: SPs and RPs systematically exceed projections. Add 500-1000% markup for low-value pitchers.

3. **Be Cautious with Mid-Tier**: Tiers 3-10 show extreme inflation. Consider stars-and-scrubs strategy.

4. **Position Strategy**:
   - Premium positions (C, 2B, SS) carry inflation premiums
   - OF and 1B are relatively efficient
   - Budget significantly more for pitching

### For Value Calculator Improvements

1. **Pitcher Valuation**: Consider increasing pitcher budget split from 32% to 40-45%

2. **Relief Pitcher Values**: Current valuations ($343-$537 for closers) are unrealistic. Cap at ~$40-50 max.

3. **Low-Value Player Floor**: Implement higher minimum values for draftable starting pitchers ($5-10 instead of $1)

4. **Tier Weighting**: Consider flattening the value curve to reduce extreme low-end values

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- Scraped 6 completed auctions from CouchManagers
- Matched 3,494 drafted players against Steamer projections
- 97.2% match rate (3,494 matched / 3,595 total drafted)

### Inflation Calculation
- Used weighted averaging to reduce low-value player distortion
- Weight dampening:
  - $1-2: 75% reduction
  - $3-5: 50% reduction
  - $6+: Full weight

### Statistical Analysis
- Tier assignment: Decile-based on projected value rankings
- Position grouping: Multi-position players counted for all positions
- Confidence intervals: 95% using standard error across auctions
